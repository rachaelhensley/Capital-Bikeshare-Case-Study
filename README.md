Case Study:
Previous research has provided us with some insight into month-to-month trends in demand suggesting some element of seasonality. Our research further supports this idea that there is a seasonality element to the bike rental demand. Further, our team analyzed what specific factors on any given day might affect bike rental demand. Mr. Goldbeck was aware that the demand for commuters over any given day was fairly equal, however we were able to dig deeper into this topic to determine external factors that would change the anticipated demand for a day.
