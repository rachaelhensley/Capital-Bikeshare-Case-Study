# Capital-Bikeshare-Case-Study
Overview: 
As a group, we analyzed the bike rental demand for a company, Capital Bikeshare. To make informed decisions about the supply of the bikes and when the best time is for them to run a promotion, we had to make sure we understood what factors affected the demand to accurately predict the rental demand. Our analysis dove into seasonality, key factors, customer differentiation, and prediction of bike rental demands.

The data sample we have access to is a mock version of their invoice data that has been approved for use in this project by the company.

Methodology:
Import and do preprocessing for data: Load the data into JMP, and create the necessary dummy variables for categorical features.

Data Analysis:
Create fit models utilizing the features to determine which features cuased multicollinearity or were not significant.
Utilized predictive modeling techniques to detemrine best method for predicting bike rentals.
Investigated seasonality through trend lines and seasonality reports.
Created conclusions and recommendations based on our findings.

Report: 
Compile a report detailing the methodology, findings, visualizations, and recommendations.

Expected Outcome: 
The expected outcome of this case study is to provide a comprehensive report that provides clear insights into the company's bike rental strategies related to minimizing loss and when to offer promotions.
